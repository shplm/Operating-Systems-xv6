This lab consists of one part. This lab is October 16th by midnight. Submit a single gzipped tar file to TEACH. The single gzipped tar file should contain the all source files (C source [*.c and *.h] and the Makefile). Submitting your solutions before October 16th will earn you a 10% bonus. You must have a Makefile to build this assignment.

This should be a pretty simple lab to complete. Look back at the code we did in class for the stat command we put in xv6.

You really want to do “man 2 stat” and read that man entry closely.
